# Coding Exercise 2

# The list below represents the ranking of three athletes. John won 1st place, Sen got 2nd, and Lisa the 3rd.

# ranking = ['John', 'Sen', 'Lisa']

# Create a program that:

# 2. Prompts the user to input a rank number.

# 3. Returns the person who has the given rank.

# For example:

# Sen



# Coding Exercise 3

# We have the same list:

# ranking = ['John', 'Sen', 'Lisa']

# This time you need to create a program that:

# 1. Contains the above list.

# 2 Prompts the user to input the person's name.

# 3. Returns the rank that person has.
