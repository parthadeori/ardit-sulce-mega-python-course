# Bug-Fixing Exercise 1
# The code below has two bugs. Hunt them down and fix them.

# while True
# print("Hello")


# Bug-Fixing Exercise 2
# The programmer here is trying to convert the string "hello" to "HELLO" by using the upper() method:

# greeting = "hello"
# print(upper(greeting))

# However, the program returns an error. Can you help fix the code, so it prints out HELLO?


# Bug-Fixing Exercise 3
# A programmer wrote the following program:

# countries = []
#      
# while True:
#    country = input("Enter the country: ")
#    countries.append(country)
# print(countries)

# The expected output is as follows:
# Enter the country: Cambodia
# ['Cambodia']
# Enter the country: Triomindia
# ['Cambodia', 'Triomindia']
# Enter the country: 

# However, the code returns an error instead of the expected output. 
# Fix the code, so it produces the expected output.
