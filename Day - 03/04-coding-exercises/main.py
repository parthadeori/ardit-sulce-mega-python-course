# Coding Exercise 1

# Create a program that does the following:

# 1. Prompts the user to input the country they are from.

# 2. If the user enters the word USA, the program prints out Hello.

# 3. If the user enters the word  India, the program prints out Namaste.

# 4. If the user enters the word Germany, the program prints out Hallo.

# Note: Strings are case-sensitive in Python, meaning germany and Germany are treated as two different strings. 




# Coding Exercise 2

# ingredients = ["john smith", "sen plakay", "dora ngacely"]

# Copy-paste the above line into your IDE and write a for-loop below that line that makes the program produce 
# the following output:

# John Smith
# Sen Plakay
# Dora Ngacely

# Tip:  Use the str.title() method to convert strings to Title Case.
