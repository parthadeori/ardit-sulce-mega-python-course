# Coding Exercise 1

# names = ["john smith", "jay santi", "eva kuki"]
# Extend the code above so the code capitalizes all the names and the surnames
# of the list and then prints the new list.
# The output of your code should be as below:
#     ['John Smith', 'Jay Santi', 'Eva Kuki']



# Coding Exercise 2

# usernames = ["john 1990", "alberta1970", "magnola2000"]
# Extend the code above so the code prints out a list containing the number of characters for each username.
# The output of your code should be as below:
#     [9, 11, 11]



# Coding Exercise 3

# user_entries = ['10', '19.1', '20']
# Extend the code above so the code prints out a list containing the same items as floats.
# The output of your code should be as below:
#     [10.0, 19.1, 20.0]



# Coding Exercise 4

# user_entries = ['10', '19.1', '20']
# Extend the code above so the code prints out the sum of the numbers.
# The output of your code should be as below:
#     49.1
# Hint: Use the sum() function. The function gets a list of numbers as input and 
# produces the sum of all numbers. For more info, try help(sum).
