# Coding Exercise 1
# The code below is incomplete. It should calculate and print out the maximum value of the grades list. 
# Please complete the function and then call it.

#     def get_max():
#         grades = [9.6, 9.2, 9.7]

# The output of your code should be:

# 9.7

# Hint: You can use the max(list) function to find the maximal value of a list.





# Coding Exercise 2
# The function we wrote in exercise 1 returned 9.7.  Change the function so this time it returns 
# Max: 9.7, Min: 9.2 where 9.7 is the maximum and 9.2 is the minimum.
