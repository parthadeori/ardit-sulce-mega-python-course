# Coding Exercise 2
# Create a script that asks the user to enter a password. Then create a function that checks the strength 
# of the user password. The function should return Strong Password if all of the following conditions are true:

# Eight or more characters

# At least one uppercase letter.

# At least one digit.

# Here is what happens when the user provides a password that satisfies all three conditions:

# Enter new password: hello123HI
# Strong password

# And if the user enters a password that breaks one of the three conditions, the program returns Weak Password:

# Enter new password: hello
# Weak password

# Note:  You can use the code we developed in the Bonus Example on Day 9.  For your convenience, you can find 
# the code we developed in that video attached to the lecture resources of this article.
