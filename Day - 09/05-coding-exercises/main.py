# Coding Exercise 1

# Write a program that asks users to enter a password. Then, it checks if the 
# password length is greater than 7 and returns "Great password there!".

# Enter a new password: mycool_password3001
# Great password there!

# If the password has 7 or fewer characters, the program returns, "Your password is weak".

# Enter a new password: 1234
# Your password is weak.






# Coding Exercise 2

# Extend the program we built in Coding Exercise 1 by adding a new feature. The new feature 
# should allow the program to return "Password is OK, but not too strong" when the password 
# is exactly seven characters long.

# Enter a new password: 1234567
# Password is OK, but not too strong
